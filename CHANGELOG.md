## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added

#### Spatial Placement Tools
- `get_scene_layout()` tool: returns every object in the scene with bounding box `[xmin,ymin,zmin,xmax,ymax,zmax]` and center point in a single call — replaces the need to call `get_object_info` for each object individually.
- `place_object(object_id, anchor, target_x, target_y, target_z)` tool: moves an object so a chosen anchor point (`base`, `center`, or `min`) lands exactly at target coordinates. Eliminates guessed delta offsets for spatial placement tasks ("sit on top of", "next to", "above").
- System prompt updated with spatial placement workflow: measure with `get_scene_layout()` → position with `place_object()`.
- Table and stacked-object building guidelines added to system prompt.

### Changed

#### Python-first Geometry Workflow
- Agent now uses `execute_python_code` with `rhinoscriptsyntax` as the **primary** path for all geometry creation (`rs.AddSphere`, `rs.AddBox`, `rs.AddCylinder`, `rs.AddCone`, `rs.AddTorus`, etc.). This returns object IDs directly and allows colour to be set in the same call via `rs.ObjectColor(id, (r, g, b))`.
- `run_rhino_command` re-scoped to view/selection/navigation commands and advanced surface ops without a `rhinoscriptsyntax` equivalent (Loft, Sweep1, FilletEdge, Revolve, ExtrudeCrv, Cap, Shell, Rebuild).
- `run_rhino_command` now auto-appends `_Enter` when not already present, preventing commands from hanging at an interactive prompt.
- Tool descriptions updated to reflect the new role split.

#### UI
- Chat panel rebranded: dark background (`#0a0a0a`) with orange accent (`#FF6B00`), replacing the previous blue scheme.
- PenguinMark SVG logo refreshed to match new colour palette.

#### Vision History
- `StripOldVisionImages()`: base64 image data is stripped from all but the most recent `capture_and_assess` turn in history, preventing token overflow across multi-capture sessions.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-23

### Added

#### Vision Loop
- `capture_and_assess(prompt)` tool: captures the active viewport as a base64-encoded PNG, injects it as an Anthropic image block into the next LLM turn, and returns the model's visual assessment. Enables self-verification after modeling steps.
- Vision thumbnails in the React UI: when `capture_and_assess` runs, the captured image is shown inline in the chat bubble alongside the model's text response.

#### Stop Button & Cancellation
- Red **■ Stop** button in the chat UI replaces the send button while a request is in progress.
- `POST /stop` server route cancels the active agent loop via `CancellationToken`.
- `CancellationToken` propagated from the HTTP request through `PenguinClawAgent.Run()` and into every `InvokeOnUiThread` dispatch.

#### Error Hardening
- `RetryPolicy`: exponential backoff (1s / 2s / 4s) on HTTP 429 and 5xx responses, max 3 retries, for both Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers.
- `ValidateToolCall()`: checks required parameters against the tool schema before dispatch; returns structured validation errors back to the model rather than throwing.
- Malformed tool call recovery: up to 2 retries per turn when `stop_reason == tool_use` but no tool calls are parsed; sends the raw response back to the model with an error prompt.
- Outer try/catch in `PenguinClawTools.Execute()` returns structured JSON including `tool`, `error`, and `suggestion` fields so the agent can self-correct.
- Action log entries for retry events (`RecordRetry`, `RecordRetryFailure`, `RecordMalformedCall`).

#### Token Usage & Cost Tracking
- `AgentResult` extended with `InputTokens`, `OutputTokens`, `CachedTokens` fields.
- `/chat` response JSON now includes token counts.
- Turn/cost counter displayed below the chat input in the React UI.

#### Provider Status Indicator
- Live green/red dot in the Settings tab pings the configured provider every 30 seconds and updates without requiring a test message.

#### Grasshopper Additions
- `solve_gh_definition` tool: triggers a new Grasshopper solution on the active canvas.
- `bake_gh_definition` tool: bakes all output geometry from the active GH canvas into the Rhino document.
- `build_gh_definition` extended with `python3` component type (creates a `GH_ScriptComponent` via reflection) and `sdk` type (GUID-based component lookup).

#### Test Suite
- xUnit test project (`PenguinClaw.Tests`, `net8.0`) — runs without Rhino installed.
- 86 tests across four files: `ProviderTests.cs` (37), `SchemaValidationTests.cs` (15), `AgentLoopTests.cs` (20), `KeywordMatcherTests.cs` (22). All pass on Ubuntu CI.
- `OverrideDispatcher` delegate in `PenguinClawTools` for mocking tool dispatch in tests.

#### CI
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): three jobs — plugin build on `windows-latest` (.NET 4.8), tests on `ubuntu-latest` (net8.0), React UI lint/build on `ubuntu-latest`.

#### Mac Support
- Windows-only `GotFocus` / WebView2 focus-recovery code in `PenguinClawPanel.cs` wrapped in `#if !__MACOS__` guards.
- OpenAI-compatible provider message builder handles `image` content blocks in OpenAI `image_url` data-URI format for vision on non-Anthropic providers.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-21

First public release.

### Added

#### Core Infrastructure
- Embedded HTTP server (`PenguinClawServer.cs`) on `localhost:8080` — `HttpListener`-based, background thread, each request dispatched to `ThreadPool`. Routes: `GET /health`, `GET /tools`, `POST /chat`, `GET /viewport`, `POST /settings`, `POST /rebuild-registry`, `GET /*` (static files).
- Dockable panel (`PenguinClawPanel.cs`) as an Eto `WebView` pointed at `localhost:8080`. WebView2 focus-loss recovery: reloads the WebView after a 3-second cooldown when Rhino regains focus, preventing the white-screen-on-tab-out bug.
- React UI (`penguinclaw/ui/App.jsx`) — Chat tab, Tools tab, Settings tab. PenguinMark SVG logo. Blue accent (`#2563EB`), off-white base (`#F7F6F2`). Built with Vite, output to `rhino_plugin/www/`, embedded into the DLL as manifest resources.
- Plugin entry point (`PenguinClawPlugin.cs`) starts the HTTP server and kicks off `RhinoCommandRegistry.Build()` on a background thread at load time.

#### AI Agent Loop
- ReAct loop (`PenguinClawAgent.cs`): receives user message + conversation history, calls the configured LLM with tool definitions, executes tool calls on the Rhino UI thread, feeds results back into the next turn. Terminates on `end_turn`, `error`, or after 25 iterations.
- `MaxTokens=8192`, `MaxIter=25`, `MaxHistory=30` messages.
- History trimming: never starts a trimmed history on an orphaned `tool_result` block.
- In-session scene state tracking: object IDs and types recorded after each tool call, injected into the system prompt for object-aware follow-ups ("move it", "scale the sphere").
- Persistent action log (`PenguinClawActionLog.cs`): up to 300 entries stored in `%APPDATA%/PenguinClaw/action_log.json`. Read-only tools are not logged. Last 25 entries formatted and appended to the system prompt as context across restarts.
- Prompt caching (Anthropic only): base system prompt, scan context, and last core tool definition each marked `cache_control: ephemeral`. After first request, cached blocks cost ~10% of normal price.

#### LLM Providers
- Anthropic provider (`AnthropicProvider`): sends Anthropic-format messages, supports `cache_control` blocks, handles `tool_use` and `end_turn` stop reasons. Default model: `claude-haiku-4-5`.
- OpenAI-compatible provider (`OpenAiCompatProvider`): shared implementation for Groq and Ollama. Converts Anthropic-format system blocks, messages (including `tool_result`/`tool_use` content), and tool definitions (`input_schema` → `parameters`) to OpenAI format.
- Groq backend via `OpenAiCompatProvider` at `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`. Default model: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.
- Ollama backend via `OpenAiCompatProvider` at configurable URL (default `http://localhost:11434/v1`). Default model: `qwen2.5:7b`. No authentication required.
- Provider selection, API key, model override, and Ollama URL persisted in `%APPDATA%/PenguinClaw/config.json`. Fallback: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.
- Human-readable API error messages for 401, 403, 429, 500, 503.

#### Core Tools (32 total, always sent to LLM)
- `get_selected_objects` — lists currently selected objects (ID, type, layer, name)
- `get_object_info` — type, layer, volume, area, bounding box for an object ID
- `get_volume` — volume of a Brep or Mesh
- `get_document_summary` — overview of all objects in the active document
- `select_objects_by_id` — selects objects by GUID array, replacing current selection
- `list_layers` — all layers with visibility and lock state
- `capture_viewport` — captures active viewport as PNG to `%TEMP%/penguinclaw/`, returns file path
- `run_rhino_command` — executes any Rhino command string via `RhinoApp.RunScript()`; returns resulting selected objects
- `execute_python_code` — runs Python code in the Rhino scripting engine with `doc` pre-set
- `move_object` — translates an object by (x, y, z) vector
- `scale_object` — scales an object uniformly in-place by a factor
- `rotate_object` — rotates an object around x/y/z axis by degrees
- `mirror_object` — mirrors an object across xy/xz/yz plane
- `array_linear` — creates N copies each offset by (dx, dy, dz)
- `array_polar` — creates N copies in a polar arrangement around a center point
- `delete_object` — deletes an object by ID
- `rename_object` — sets the name of an object by ID
- `undo` — calls `doc.BeginUndoRecord` / undoes N steps
- `redo` — redoes N steps
- `create_layer` — creates a new layer by name
- `set_current_layer` — sets the active layer
- `set_object_layer` — moves an object to a named layer
- `set_object_color` — sets object display colour (R, G, B 0–255)
- `boolean_union` — merges an array of solid Breps
- `boolean_difference` — subtracts cutter Breps from target Breps
- `boolean_intersection` — keeps the overlapping volume of two Brep sets
- `join_curves` — joins an array of open curves into a single polycurve
- `list_gh_sliders` — lists all Number Sliders on the active GH canvas
- `set_gh_slider` — sets a GH slider value by NickName, triggers new solution
- `list_gh_components` — lists all components on the active GH canvas
- `build_gh_definition` — programmatically builds a GH definition: creates components (slider, panel, toggle, or any component type by name) and wires them together

#### Dynamic Tool Registry
- `RhinoCommandRegistry`: builds a runtime index of every Rhino command and every installed GH component on a background thread at startup.
- Per-request keyword matching: tokenizes the user message, scores each `gh_comp_*` entry by token overlap, returns top-5 most relevant GH component tools. `rhino_cmd_*` entries excluded (covered by `run_rhino_command`).
- `PenguinClawScan` command: deep-indexes the Grasshopper `ComponentServer.ObjectProxies` registry, writes `scan_output.json`, rebuilds the in-memory registry via `POST /rebuild-registry`. Picks up third-party and user-installed GH plugins.
- Fallback command dictionary (80+ common Rhino commands with descriptions) for environments where `Command.GetCommandNames()` is unavailable.

#### Thread Safety
- All `RhinoDoc`/`RhinoApp`/Grasshopper calls dispatched to the UI thread via `RhinoApp.InvokeOnUiThread` + `ManualResetEventSlim` with a 30-second timeout.
- Grasshopper interop via reflection (`Assembly.Load("Grasshopper")`) — no hard compile-time GH.dll reference.
